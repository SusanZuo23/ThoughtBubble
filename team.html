    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      Founded in 2024 at the Winsor School in Boston, MA, we started ThoughtBubble because we always believed that psychology is the path to understanding people, communities, and the world we live in. What began as a shared curiosity between us has now evolved into a space where students can explore ideas, ask questions, and connect over how the mind shapes everyday life.
    </p>
    <p>
      As co-founders, we love creating opportunities for conversation, whether through our podcast episodes or discussion amongst our members. We believe that ThoughtBubble is about making psychology accessible, meaningful, and fun. Our hope is that every person who engages with us leaves with a new perspective, and maybe even a newfound love for this fascinating field.
